# runs, in the same commands, so a change that passes here passes
# there. The Go driver is the module at the root, so its checks are
# here. The docs are their own domain with their own Makefile.

# The coverage floors are the one number each gate enforces: the Go
# floor is in .testcoverage.yml. CI reads the same file, so a floor
# moves in one place.

# The coverage gate measures on its own run, on a pinned toolchain.
# Go 1.27 splits a basic block into one profile row per run of code
# inside it, and repeats the whole block's statement count on every
# row. Every reader sums those rows, `go tool cover` included, so a
# block counts once more for each comment that interrupts it. Go 1.26
# counts each block once, which is what .testcoverage.yml's threshold
# was set against. Move this pin to the newest toolchain that counts
# each block once.

# go-test-coverage is a pinned tool dependency (the `tool` directive
# in go.mod), so the gate needs nothing installed beyond the Go
# toolchain.
