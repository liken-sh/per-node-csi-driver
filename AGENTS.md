# Working on the per-node CSI driver

This repository is a Kubernetes CSI driver that gives a pod a directory
on the node it runs on, on a [`liken`](https://liken.sh/) cluster. The
directory stays on the node when the pod leaves, and a pod on another
node gets a directory of its own there. The Go files, the manifests, and
the workflows are the documentation, and the comments teach how the
system works.

@docs/themes/brand/voice.md

The voice rules in that file govern all prose in this repository,
comments included. They arrive with the brand theme submodule at
`docs/themes/brand`.

`plans/00-design.md` is the design, and `plans/README.md` indexes the
plans that build it. Code exists only where a plan calls for it. A plan
states contracts and leaves the shape of the code to the person or agent
who builds it.

## Errors include their source's text

An error that wraps a tool, a daemon socket, a bus answer, or a provider
includes that source's own text word for word: its `stderr`, its
response body, or its error string. The wrapped error and the status
field or record that the failure writes both include it, so a person
reads the cause from the log or the status without opening a shell.

## The lab

Nothing in this repository is installed on a real cluster until a person
has seen it work. `lab/` boots one `liken` machine in QEMU from the
public release channel. Every drill runs there.

## Releases and development builds

A pushed tag is a release. The tag names a version in `liken`'s calendar
scheme, for example `2026.09.07-001`. `release.yaml` builds every image
in the repository beside the `ci.yaml` run of the same commit, waits for
that run to pass, and pushes the images under the version tag and under
`:latest`.

A push to `main` is a development build. `release.yaml` builds the
images the same way and pushes them under a version from `git describe`:
the most recent release tag, the number of commits since it, and the
first eight characters of the commit. For example,
`2026.09.07-001-dev-003-abcdef01` is three commits past
`2026.09.07-001`, at commit `abcdef01`. A development build never moves
`:latest`, so a cluster that pulls a release keeps pulling releases.
The suffix sorts after its release and before the next one, and the tag
check in `release.yaml` does not accept it as a release version.

To run a development build, pin the manifests to the full commit sha
and the image to the build's version:

    resources:
      - https://github.com/liken-sh/per-node-csi-driver//deploy?ref=<full 40-character sha>
    images:
      - name: ghcr.io/liken-sh/per-node-csi-driver
        newTag: 2026.09.07-001-dev-003-abcdef01

Use all forty characters of the commit sha in `ref=`. A `git fetch` by
sha requires all forty, and the eight characters inside the version are
not enough. The CI run's step summary prints these lines for the commit.
