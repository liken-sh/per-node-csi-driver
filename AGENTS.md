# Working on the per-node CSI driver

This repository is a Kubernetes CSI driver that gives a pod a directory
on the node it runs on, on a [`liken`](https://liken.sh/) cluster. The
directory stays on the node when the pod leaves, and a pod on another
node gets a directory of its own there. Like the rest of the `liken`
project, it is written to be read: the Go files, manifests, and
workflows are the documentation.

@docs/themes/brand/voice.md

The voice rules imported above govern all prose in this repository,
comments included, and they arrive with the brand theme submodule at
`docs/themes/brand`.

`plans/00-design.md` is the design, and `plans/README.md` indexes the
plans that build it. Code exists only where a plan calls for it. A
plan states contracts and leaves the shape of the code to the person
or agent who builds it.

## Errors carry their source's words

An error that wraps a tool, a daemon socket, a bus answer, or a
provider carries that source's own text: the stderr, the body, or the
error string, verbatim. It goes in the wrapped error and in whatever
status field or record the failure writes, so a person reads the cause
from the log or the status and never needs a shell to find it.

## The lab

Nothing in this repository is installed on a real cluster until a
person has seen it work. `lab/` boots one `liken` machine in QEMU from
the public release channel. Every drill runs there.

## Releases and development builds

A pushed tag is a release. It names a version in liken's calendar
scheme, `2026.09.07-001`, and `release.yaml` builds the image and
pushes it under that tag and `:latest`.

A push to main is a development build. `release.yaml` builds the same
image beside the `ci.yaml` run of the same commit, waits for that run
to pass before it pushes anything, and pushes the image under the most
recent release tag, from `git describe`, plus a suffix:
`2026.09.07-001-dev-003-abcdef01` is three commits past that release,
at commit `abcdef01`. `:latest` never moves on a development build,
and the tag shape check in `release.yaml` never accepts the suffix.

To run a development build, pin the manifests to the full sha of the
commit and the image to the version:

    resources:
      - https://github.com/liken-sh/per-node-csi-driver//deploy?ref=<full 40-character sha>
    images:
      - name: ghcr.io/liken-sh/per-node-csi-driver
        newTag: 2026.09.07-001-dev-003-abcdef01

A git fetch by sha needs all forty characters, so the short sha in the
version is not enough for `ref=`. The CI run's step summary prints
both lines for that commit.
